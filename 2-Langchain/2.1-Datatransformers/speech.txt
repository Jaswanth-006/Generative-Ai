This course gives an insight to the important problems in operating system design and implementation.  
 This course helps the students to understand the operating system responsibilities like sharing 
resources, files, memory and process scheduling.  
This course covers the major components of most operating systems and the trade-offs between 
performance and functionality in the design and implementation of an operating system.  
 In this course, emphasis will be given to three major OS subsystems: process management, memory 
management, and file systems; and on operating system support for distributed systems.
